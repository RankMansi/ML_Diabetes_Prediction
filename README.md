# ML Diabetes Prediction

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on several health-related features.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals. The dataset used comprises various health metrics like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc., obtained from patients.

## Methodology

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes health-related metrics from patients, collected through medical examinations and tests.

### Models
Several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines were chosen to build predictive models due to their effectiveness in classification tasks.

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering for better model performance.
2. Model Training: Employing different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and selecting the best-performing model.
3. Evaluation: Assessing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their predictive capability.
4. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in new individuals.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of `Y%` on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the onset of diabetes based on the given health metrics.

## Contributions
Contributions to enhance model accuracy, feature selection, data preprocessing techniques, or any other improvements are encouraged! Fork the repository, create a new branch, implement changes, and open a pull request for review.
